Binary Search Algorithm
This repository contains a Java implementation of the binary search algorithm. The binary search algorithm is an efficient method for searching for a target value within a sorted list or array.

Usage
To use the binary search algorithm, you can create an instance of the BinarySearch class and call its search method:

java
Copy code
int[] arr = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};
int target = 7;

BinarySearch binarySearch = new BinarySearch();
int result = binarySearch.search(arr, target);

if (result != -1) {
    System.out.println("Element " + target + " is present at index " + result);
} else {
    System.out.println("Element is not present in array");
}
The search method returns the index of the target element if it is present in the array, otherwise it returns -1.
